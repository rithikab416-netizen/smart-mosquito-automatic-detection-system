# 🦟 Smart Mosquito & Insect Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an advanced *software-based mosquito and insect detection system*
that simulates real-world sensors using environmental parameters such as
sound level, temperature, and humidity.

Based on intelligent rule-based logic, the system automatically detects
mosquito presence and activates a simulated control mechanism.
The project is designed to be extended into a *hardware-based IoT system in the future*.
